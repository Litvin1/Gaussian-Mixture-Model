# Gaussian-Mixture-Model
Question 4 in the problem set.
First, we use the Gaussian mixture model to generate 20 samples with predefined means and variances of three gaussians. Then, we used the EM algorithm to estimate those parameters and plotted the log-likelihood. And finally, we generated 200 samples and saw the EM converge to different solutions, which means it found a local optima.
